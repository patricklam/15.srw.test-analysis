Title: Static and Dynamic Analysis of Test Suites

Test suites are a rich yet untapped source of developer-provided
information about desired program behaviour. Presently, tool support
for test suites is, for the most part, limited to computing code
coverage. I will discuss the potential benefits of applying novel
static and dynamic analysis techniques to test suites, both in
combination with the system under test as well as on the test suite
alone. Test suites could be used to improve the accuracy of dynamic
or concolic program analyses, and could provide more context about the
program to static analyses. As a specific example of a test-only
analysis, I will describe my analysis of test suites to find similar
test methods amenable to refactoring.
